# 🎨 Bezier and B-Spline Curves

This project is a **Python-based graphical application** built using **PyQt5** and **Matplotlib** that allows users to visualize and interact with **Bezier** and **B-Spline** curves.  
Users can either import control points from a `.txt` file or add them directly through the interface, then visualize the resulting curve.

## 🧭 Overview

The project provides an intuitive way to understand how **Bezier** and **B-Spline** curves behave by allowing interactive manipulation of control points.  
It is implemented in **Python** using **PyQt5** for the GUI and **Matplotlib** for curve rendering.

You can load control points from a text file for Bezier curves, or manually add points for B-Spline curves.
